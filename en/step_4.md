## Making a grid

- In this game, your going to produce a grid of stamped costumes, just like the one below.

- To do this you will need to know the `x` and `y` coordinates where each stamp is going to be placed. Have a look at the section below if you need a reminder about Scratch coordinates.

- To begin with you'll need to create a new **block** called `generate positions` for you spite. The block will need to have **two** `number inputs`.
