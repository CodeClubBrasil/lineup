## Taking it further
- Here are some ideas for further additions to your game that could make it more interesting.
  1. Can you alter your scripts so that you can use even more costumes?
  1. How about choosing a background and then making the sprites nearer the top of the screen appear smaller, so they seem further away.
  1. Can you make the game repeat, and provide you with a score based on your time to complete five attempts?
